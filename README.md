# WebLoader
A bootloader for embedded Scratch projects, that supports metadata.

# Adding WebLoader to a project

To add WebLoader, make sure that `Sprite1` is in the front layer, and replace the `when green flag clicked` with `when I receive boot` on every other sprite.

# Info screen

When you see the WebLoader splashscreen hold `b` immediatly and if you do it right, you should get to a sort-of credits screen. Make sure to modify the `content name` and `content version` with your own number and name.
